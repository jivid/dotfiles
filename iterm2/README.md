To use caps+[b/f] to navigate text on shell
* Install karabiner-elements
* Create complex modification to remap caps lock to escape if pressed alone, and left option with lazy=true if held down
* Make sure iterm2 settings (profile > keys > General) have left option key as Esc+ (this is done in iterm2.json already)
